# Welcome to the Phillpot Research Group!

## Introduction
We are glad you have an interest in the work we do here. Consider this repository as the syllabus for your introductory course in computational materials science. Due to the computational nature of our work, our members should be familiar with using basic linux commands in the terminal and have some programming experience (preferably in Python). If you know nothing about either, have no fear, this guide will teach you!

## Step 1 - Practice Some Basic Linux Commands
- write stuff about linux commands

## Step 2 - Install and Familiarize Yourself with `git`
- write stuff about git

## Step 3 - Complete a Python Tutorial
- write stuff about python

## Step 4 - Get an Account on HiPerGator

## Step 5 - Run Some Simulations!

### GULP - General Utility Lattice Program
- write stuff about gulp

### LAMMPS - Large-scale Atomic Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator
- write stuff about lammps

### VASP - Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package
- write stuff about vasp
